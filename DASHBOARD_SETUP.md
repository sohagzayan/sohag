## 🚀 **IMPORTANT: Starting the Server**

### The Issue
Port 7000 was occupied by **Prisma Studio**. The dashboard needs the Next.js dev server running on port 7000.

### Solution: Start the Development Server

**Option 1: In Terminal (Recommended)**
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "/Users/sohaghossain/Desktop/personal/Update Life/sohag.com"

# Make sure port 7000 is free
lsof -ti:7000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**Option 2: Use Prisma Studio on a Different Port**
If you want to use Prisma Studio alongside the dev server:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Next.js server on port 7000
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Start Prisma Studio on port 5555 (different port)
npx prisma studio
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard shows "API Connection Error"

**Solutions:**
1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check port 7000 is free:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :7000
   # If something is running, kill it:
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

3. **Verify API routes exist:**
   ```bash
   ls src/app/api/v1/
   # Should show: profile, skills, experiences, etc.
   ```

4. **Test an API endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/profile
   # Should return JSON with success: true
   ```

### Issue: Dashboard shows old data

**Solution:**
- Click the **Refresh** button in the dashboard header
- Or reseed the database:
  ```bash
  npm run db:seed
  ```

### Issue: Some cards show 0

**Possible causes:**
- Database is empty (run `npm run db:seed`)
- API endpoint is failing (check browser console)
- Network issue (check dev server is running)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Customize Your Data
```bash
# Edit the seed script
nano prisma/seed.ts

# Reseed the database
npm run db:seed
```

### 2. Add Your Real Data
